# Project No. 2:
# To do list: A simple program which will store task and display menu with options.

#First we import "os" library.
import os

#Define the filename for storing the tasks
TASK_FILE = "tasks.txt"

#Check if the task file exists. If not, create it.
if not os.path.isfile(TASK_FILE):       #It is checking the file path.
    with open(TASK_FILE, "w") as f:     #It opens the file if present,otherwise creates one.
        f.write("")

#Function to load the tasks from the file into the tasks list.
def load_tasks():
    with open(TASK_FILE, "r") as f:     #Opens the file as readable only.
        tasks = f.readlines()
    #Remove the newline characters from each task.
    tasks = [task.strip() for task in tasks]
    return tasks

#Save the tasks from the list to the file
def save_tasks(tasks):
    with open(TASK_FILE, "w") as f:     #Opens the file in editable to save the changes made.
        for task in tasks:
            f.write(task + "\n")

#Print a welcome message
print("Welcome to To Do List")

#Load the tasks from the file
tasks = load_tasks()

#Define the functions to add, view, delete, and mark tasks as done.
#Function to add a new task.

    tasks.append(new_task)                          #Append the new task.

    print(f"Task '{new_task}' added successfully!") #Print an appropiate statment regarding task being added.
#Function to view task.

    if not tasks:                           #Checking if there is any task to view.
        print("No Task to display yet")     #Print an appropiate statement.

            print(f"{i+1}.{tasks[i]}")      #{i+1} is for numbering tasks , {task[i]} prints the task from the list.
